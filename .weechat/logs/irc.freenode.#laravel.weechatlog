2015-09-06 12:03:40	Anonaly	I remved the cloned homestead directory
2015-09-06 12:03:53	Anonaly	the git clone command was optional apparently
2015-09-06 12:04:07	sisve	ari```, Anonaly: All php errors are due to homestead being a php script. "homestead ssh" executes a php-script that starts ssh.
2015-09-06 12:04:09	Anonaly	and all I need to do is  the vagrant box add laravel/homestead
2015-09-06 12:04:29	ari```	sisve, ok I wasnt aware of that
2015-09-06 12:04:29	bannakaffalatta	well that's step 1
2015-09-06 12:04:36	ari```	I saw all this RUBY commands executing
2015-09-06 12:04:40	sisve	../../autoload.php exists after a "composer dump-autoload"... if the other paths are okay.
2015-09-06 12:04:43	ari```	I was like, why do I need ruby?
2015-09-06 12:04:54	sisve	ari```: The vagrant scripts are ruby.
2015-09-06 12:05:05	bannakaffalatta	^'
2015-09-06 12:05:13	ari```	ok
2015-09-06 12:05:24	sisve	Anonaly: if you do a "locate Homestead.yaml", where are the files?
2015-09-06 12:05:27	ari```	so in order to be a productive developer in 2015 I need ruby, node.js, and PHP?
2015-09-06 12:05:28	ari```	wtf

2015-09-06 15:28:33	sisve	Laravel has laracast, is a well known system, and everything. October is a non-stable cms that's not used widely, and we cant get to work properly.
2015-09-06 15:28:43	theWhisperIn	how easy is to create a photo upload and display in laravel?
2015-09-06 15:29:05	Anonaly	right k I guess I just don't know where to start with css and all
2015-09-06 15:29:26	Anonaly	I need something that has a menu at the top and a signin / signout link somewhere
2015-09-06 15:29:39	ari```	you need to not try to skip steps!
2015-09-06 15:29:46	ari```	you gotta crawl before you can walk, my friend!

2015-09-06 15:30:38	Anonaly	take the images and the css folders and place them in the public folder
2015-09-06 15:30:50	ari```	if your goal is to simply spit out a quick site, fine
2015-09-06 15:30:54	ari```	if your goal is to learn, very bad idea
2015-09-06 15:30:59	ari```	do it from scratch
2015-09-06 15:31:07	ari```	when you are experienced, THEN you can take shortcuts
2015-09-06 15:31:29	Anonaly	yeah I know I can write all the code to get the menu and the header and all of that with html the long way, but why ?
2015-09-06 15:31:35	Anonaly	it would look like crap
2015-09-06 15:31:44	ari```	Only because you are not experienced
2015-09-06 15:32:02	Anonaly	well that too
2015-09-06 15:32:05	Anonaly	yes
2015-09-06 15:32:07	sisve	theWhisperIn: Very easy.

2015-09-06 15:33:12	theWhisperIn	sisve: any library for this?
2015-09-06 15:33:12	ari```	many many years ago I was a java developer
2015-09-06 15:33:14	sisve	Woho! Children, gather around ari```!
2015-09-06 15:33:20	ari```	And we were making desktop apps
2015-09-06 15:33:30	xenomorph	sisve theWhisperIn and not to forget, there's http://image.intervention.io/ for image manipulation
2015-09-06 15:33:32	ari```	At the time I thought we should use the GUI buiolder to do everything
2015-09-06 15:33:45	ari```	but I was immediately shunned for this
2015-09-06 15:33:51	ari```	and told to manually write the GUI code
2015-09-06 15:33:55	ari```	I thought that was stupid
2015-09-06 15:34:01	ari```	but eventually I realized they were right
2015-09-06 15:34:11	ari```	because I learned what was happening "under the hood" so to speak
2015-09-06 15:34:20	Anonaly	right
2015-09-06 15:34:26	Anonaly	ok well I understand that
2015-09-06 15:34:40	Anonaly	and I have done my fair share of html editing
2015-09-06 15:34:43	Anonaly	css editing
2015-09-06 15:34:51	xenomorph	Thank you for sharing your story with us, ari``` ;)
